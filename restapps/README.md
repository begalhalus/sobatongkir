### Flow Development

During the development cycle, a variety of supporting branches are used :

- **\*feature/\*\*** -- feature branches are used to development new features for the upcoming releases. May branch off from development and must merge into development.
- **\*hotfix/\*\*** -- hotfix branches are necessary to act immediately upon an undesired status of master. May branch off from master and must merge into master, staging, and development.

Creating a new **_feature_**

1. create new branch from development. ex: `feature/name-of-feature`.
1. write your code.
1. commit & push your work to the same named branch on the server.
1. create PR into development branch for testing in dev server.

Creating a new **_hotfix_**
